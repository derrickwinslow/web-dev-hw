# Assignment-7: Typography

For this assignment I wanted to make the article seem spooky. With the fonts I used I wanted
the page to look as though it was a Halloween or horror based website, I used Cinzel Font.
On the title I used Fjalla+One and EB+Garamond font.

System fonts: The fonts that are already factory installed on your computer.

Web fonts: Require specific elements in order to work correctly.

Web Safe fonts: Fonts that can work on all systems, commonly found in Windows or Mac.

I had a hard time with this assignment, I'm used to being able to download a font
from dafont.com and installing it on my computer to use in Photoshop for example
