## Padding, Margins and Borders
Padding is the amount of space between the inner content of the element and the element itself. Margin is the space between the box/element and other elements, or the edge of the parent element.

## Hardest task
I had a hard time moving the pictures around and I also found it difficult getting my fonts to work. I went with comic sans because I felt it looked more retro and went with the ad but I had a hard time lining everything up.

## Work Cycle
Downloaded all material. Created folders, grandchild folders etc.  It took me a while to make sense of all the material but after getting everything organized I was able to link and code everything. Still had a lot of problems lining up images and font.
