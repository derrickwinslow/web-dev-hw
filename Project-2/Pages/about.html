           I created this website to teach people how to defend themselves in a really bad position.
             When you are attacked, you will most likely end up on the ground. <br /> This position works very well against larger/stornger attackers.

                      I am Derrick Winslow, a mixed martial artist/BJJ practioner
                        and I am currently attending the <strong> University of Montana </strong>. <br /> I have fought in many Jiu-Jitsu tournaments and mixed martial arts bouts, but I was actually very terrified of fighting as a child. <br />
                          I had zero self confidence and was terrified of getting beat up. I decided to learn Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu to defend myself after watchign Royce Gracie beat much larger opponents. <br/>
                            After learning to fight I gained a lot of self respectadn that tranisitioned to all aspects of my life. <br /> I want to show people the powers of Jiu-Jitsu, I owe my life to martial arts.
                          about me so I'm not such a stranger. I have a few hobbies, <br /> I love to listen to music, create music,
