Assignment 6

For this assignment I chose to do the colors of the 90s. I chose Teal #00dbdb, yellow #ffff24 and purple #ff00ff. After researching 90s colors schemes I chose these three as I felt they were representative of the decade. They reminded me of the classic 90s Dixie Cup.

I initially had problems getting the borders to work but after many google searches and looking at other codes for reference I was able to get my border colors to work.
